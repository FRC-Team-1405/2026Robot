Note this requires StatorCurrentLimitEnable to be true.\n\nFor torque current control, this is applied in addition to the PeakForwardTorqueCurrent and PeakReverseTorqueCurrent in TorqueCurrentConfigs.\n\nStator current is directly proportional to torque, so this limit can be used to restrict the torque output of the motor, such as preventing wheel slip for a drivetrain.  Additionally, stator current limits can prevent brownouts during acceleration; supply current will never exceed the stator current limit and is often significantly lower than stator current.\n\nA reasonable starting point for a stator current limit is 120 A, with values commonly ranging from 80-160 A. Mechanisms with a hard stop may need a smaller limit to reduce the torque applied when running into the hard stop.",
